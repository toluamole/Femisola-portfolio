                        Navigating the food scene can be quite hectic in Nigeria especially those in busy cities like Lagos where people work more than they live. 
                        Finding a decent place to hang out, eat at reasonable prices can be a chore. There really isn’t any way for people to find good restaurants and know their price offerings for food. 
                        What one gets most times are instagram posts by food reviewers or poorly written blogs that just gives a brief view into what these restaurants offer.

                        I was Lead Product Designer for this project. 
                        The project had a short deadline and I was handed a PRD.  
                        I decided to conduct some research to get more direction on what I was building before heading into creating prototypes.

                        To kickoff the project, I and the other designer assigned to the project decided to have a sit down with the PM to understand the requirements and have a clear direction. 
                        Due to legal constraints, I won’t be able to reveal the full insights we got, but we had a couple of how might we’s, 
                        one of which was “How might we make users see top restaurants with the best offers”, “How might we make our membership cards work like debit cards”.
                        After our discussions, we decided to go with a wallet and cards system for our membership cards and also, a subscription model.

                        After defining our structure and conversing with key stakeholders,  it was time to start fleshing out the screens. 
                        I already had  a direction in mind so I did not make a serious moodboard for this project.

                        To view different highlighted features, a user clicks on any and see’s the restaurants that exist in said collection.

                        Once a user clicks on a restaurant card,

                        This was an interesting project for me, as it gave me the chance to solve a problem that affected me personally too. 
                        It also helped me understand that I shouldn’t build for myself. 
                        The fact that this was a problem I face also, almost put me in that box where some of the solutions 
                        I wanted to create were tailored to me but I hhad to understand that I’m not the only person that will use this product. 
                        There are quite a number of people with different ideologies, thought processes etc that will use this.<br/>
                        It really was an interesting project.
